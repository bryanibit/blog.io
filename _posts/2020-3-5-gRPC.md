## Install gPRC

Two methods are recommanded by google. The first one is to build projects from main directory and other **module** will be built and installed automatically (this one is called *module mode*) and the second is to build submodule (grpc dependent lib) respectively and build grpc then (this one is call *package mode*). Here, I recommand the latter. And installation turorial is mainly refered to [**stackoverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57413975/cmake-with-grpc-cannot-find-grpctargets-cmake) and its [**github**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/2b0ab320c12cb807cf05b3295b7017d0ccbf66f5/test/distrib/cpp/run_distrib_test_cmake.sh#L56).  
1. **Install dependent libs**  
```sh
# Install c-ares
cd third_party/cares/cares
git fetch origin
git checkout cares-1_13_0
# I used the e982924 commit id version
mkdir -p cmake/build
cd cmake/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
make -j4 install
cd ../../../../..
rm -rf third_party/cares/cares  # wipe out to prevent influencing the grpc build
# Install zlib
cd third_party/zlib
mkdir -p cmake/build
cd cmake/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
make -j4 install
cd ../../../..
rm -rf third_party/zlib  # wipe out to prevent influencing the grpc build
# Install protobuf
cd third_party/protobuf
mkdir -p cmake/build
cd cmake/build
cmake -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4 install
cd ../../../..
rm -rf third_party/protobuf  # wipe out to prevent influencing the grpc build
```
2. **Install grpc lib**
```sh
# Install gRPC
mkdir -p cmake/build
cd cmake/build
cmake -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON -DgRPC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DgRPC_PROTOBUF_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_ZLIB_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_CARES_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_SSL_PROVIDER=package -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
make -j4 install
```
But cmake command shows me a warning, like that(I met the warning about lib:ABSL):
```
CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:143 (message):
gRPC_INSTALL will be forced to FALSE because gRPC_ABSL_PROVIDER is
"module"
```
The problem can be solve via [**stackoverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57413975/cmake-with-grpc-cannot-find-grpctargets-cmake). In accordance to the words:  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Because of some limitations of our current CMakeLists.txt, the install targets (see gRPC_INSTALL option) will only be generated if you are building using a **pre-installed** version of our dependencies (gRPC_CARES_PROVIDER in your case needs to be set to package). The warning you saw "gRPC_INSTALL will be forced to FALSE because gRPC_CARES_PROVIDER" is "module" basically tells you that even though gRPC_INSTALL was set to ON by you, we're setting it back to OFF because your gRPC_CARES_PROVIDER is set to use c-ares from git submodule (which wouldn't work well with the current CMakeLists.txt) - so you shouldn't expect anything to be installed (not even grpc_cpp_plugin.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
We should replace it with the following command (adding `-DgRPC_ABSL_PROVIDER=package`):
```
cmake -DgRPC_ABSL_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON -DgRPC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DgRPC_PROTOBUF_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_ZLIB_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_CARES_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_SSL_PROVIDER=package -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
```
Maybe we don't install **ABSL** lib on linux at the time, then go to *grpc/third_party/abseil-cpp* and build the lib:
```sh
cd grpc/third_party/abseil-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
# add definition, if not, static lib will be build
# static libs cannot be linked to dynamic libs
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
make install
```
Here I just adopt ABSL as an example. You can find it in *third_party* dir if lacking some libs. Don't forget to use `git submodule update --init` to download codes.  
3. **Build helloworld example with CMakeLists.txt**
```sh
cd grpc/examples/cpp/helloworld
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```
