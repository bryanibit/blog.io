temperament
deficient deficiency
If you have a fixed mindset, you would think about failure for lack of capacity. For example, if IQ determinds people's
success in their lives, the unchangeable intelligence will make people hide their deficiency. People just want to show
they are smart and not dumb but they do not learn to improve themselves. On the contrary, people with grown mindset would
think a failure as no success just for now. They may think the current problem with grown insight.

How a belief that your qualities are carved in stone leads to a host of thoughts and actions, and how a belief that
your qualities can be cultivated leads to a host of different thoughts and actions, taking you down
to a different road. If reorienting your mindset, them personal revolution may happen to you.

It is reported that people with grown mindset have more accurate estimation about themselves than ones with fixed
mindset. Author sets out to see men with fixed mindset misestimate their ability and performance. Grown mindset
can produce important ingredients called perseverance and resilience in creative achievement.

Fix maindsets would put an end to exuberant leanrings. It makes people think intelligence and talent is fix and could
not grow up through learning. However, in an experiment, children with challengable mindset reject doing the same puzzles
one after another. They'd like to try something new. In another experiment, people with fixed mindset just feel themselves
smart in the short run, instead of seizing the chance to learn English which they are not good at. People with fixed
mindsets pay close attention to the information proving them smart, but only for people with grown mindsets are learning
a priority.

Each of us is faced with a blizzard of situations we must respond to. Without principles we would be forced to
respond to all the things life throws at us individually, as if we were experiencing each of them for the first
time. So it is important to be clear about what your principles are. You can gain principles from religons, from
 your parents, or from other strange people. But you should understand what principle is suitable for your nature and your goals.
 If you summon up the courage to find out what principle is best for yourselve, you will make the best of yout life.

First of all, I want to cite the book:  
Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can't stop our movement down this river and we can't avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way. Author fears boredom and mediocrity more than he fears failure. Author chooses a different path from oridinary people, but he with oridinary people has innate strength and weakness. How can he achieve the distinctive? Author is experiencing something different from us and thinks a lot after failure, I think.

## Listening

As the individual matures, that overt talking to oneself becomes covert talking to oneself, but thinking still shows up as a laryngeal habit.    
Thinking is identical with the activity of muscles.  
There are charcoal marks from their **torches** on the cave walls clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made.  

The artists were highly skilled at using, or even enhancing, the natural shape of the cave walls to give depth and perspectives to their drawings, the sense of motion and vitality in these animals.

Was it for their religion, magic or sheer beauty?   
There are charcoal marks from their torches on the cave walls clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made.

The National Endowment for the Arts was created.  
The government made it attractive for them to do so, by offering corporations tax"-"incentives to support the arts.  
But they only succeeded in taking away about half the annual budget.  

It seems a little all over the place, but from farther away, the true path shows and in the end it justifies all the turns along the way.  
We can explore its analogy with the transmission of genes.

Higher education is the place where people who have a big plan in high school **get stuck in** fierce rivalries with equally smart peers.  
For the privilege of **being turned into conformists**, they pay hundreds of thousands of dollars **in skyrocketing tuition** that continues to **outpace inflation**.
