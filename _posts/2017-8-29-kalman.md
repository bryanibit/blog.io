## Problem Statement

[Kalman Filter Equation Explanation](http://bilgin.esme.org/BitsAndBytes/KalmanFilterforDummies)

The better you estimate the noise parameters, the better estimates you get.

KF is an iteration process with two phases called Time Update(*state prediction*) and Measurement Update(*correction*).

All in all, the KF is shown like that:

If $K_k$ is constant like 0.5, then $X_k$ is like half of measured value plus half of previous history value. Unfortunately, it is more sophisticated in fact.

The iteration process is shown the following:
