## **----Salvation lies within.----**

# GoAgent

Download GoAgent which has been employed.(Your own cloud space)

## Setting

### Chrome on Windows

1. Download [xx-net](https://github.com/bryanibit/XX-Net)
2. Upload goagent account to xx-net on chrome
3. Use it

### Firefox on ubuntu with foxproxy

1. *Download foxproxy*  
2. *Add new pattern to foxproxy*  
* Manually add 127.0.0.1:8087 to the pattern  
* Do not use this proxy for internal IP addresses  
3. *Pattern Subscription*  
* Subscription URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gfwlist/gfwlist/master/gfwlist.txt 
* Proxies: add proxies with GoAgent of process 2  
* Format: Autoproxy obfuscation: base64  
4. *Quick add*  
* enabled  

## Terminal use

1. Directly use the commands in terminal or add them to *bashrc*, as follow.  
```sh
  export https_proxy="127.0.0.1:8087"
  export http_proxy="127.0.0.1:8087"
```
The following processes are optional: ```git config --global http.sslVerify false```. Then git config uses proxy agent. Or use the following to open http channel:
```
git config --global http.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1080' 
git config --global https.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:1080'
```
When you use export, you could use ```curl ip.gs``` to check the ip address.  
Of course, you should install curl with ```sudo apt-get install curl```.  
2. Use alias in terminal, add the following to *bashrc*.  

```sh
# another way to add proxy for ss proxy
alias setproxy="export ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
alias unsetproxy="unset ALL_PROXY"
```

### Release busy port with GoAgent

**Because GoAgent is busy with port 8087**

```
inin@inin-pc:~$ sudo lsof -i:8087
COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
python  2274 root    6u  IPv4  16595      0t0  TCP localhost:8087 (LISTEN)
inin@inin-pc:~$ kill 2274
```

# xx-net

Log in [xx-net](https://github.com/XX-net/XX-Net/wiki/How-to-use) and download source code. And no need to download GoAgent in Baidu cloud.

1. Install the following software
```
sudo apt-get install python-openssl
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
sudo apt-get install python-gtk2
sudo apt-get install python-appindicator
sudo apt-get install libnss3-tools
```
2. Run background: carry out the command:
```
xx_net.sh start/stop/restart
```
At this time, input ```127.0.0.1:8085``` to browser. Adopt the way of "Firefox on ubuntu with foxproxy" to employ brower setting.

3. AutoBoot when start PC(optional): add the following content to ```/etc/rc.local```:
```
sudo /home/username/xxnet/xx_net.sh start
```
# vps配置

我还没有试试上面教程，只是我的同学试过，可以使用。

# Shadownsocks setting

## Shadowsocks on ubuntu

1. Install ss-qt5

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hzwhuang/ss-qt5
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install shadowsocks-qt5
```
You can also go to [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/) and search .deb file and install it.

2. Renew gui-config.json at any place.

3. Open terminal and input ```ss-qt5```

4. In pop out gui named *connection Manager*, **file -> import Connections from gui-config.json**(choose gui-config.json renewed in the second process)

5. Config brower proxy setting

## Shadowsocks on macOS

refer to the [link](https://lvii.gitbooks.io/outman/content/) and download shadowsocks.

# Google cloud platform vm

GCP is far more expensive than other agencies like bandwagonHost([搬瓦工](https://bandwagonhost.com)), [vultr](https://www.vultr.com/).

## Register account

Register Google cloud platform, renew a project and renew a vm instance in the project, choose *asia area*, choose *single cpu*, and choose system as
```
Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
amd64 built on 20180611
```
check *allow HTTP and HTTPS* data.

## Install BBR and shadowsocks

Use ssh to log in the VM instance:

```
sudo -i
wget -N --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FunctionClub/YankeeBBR/master/bbr.sh && bash bbr.sh install
wget -N --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teddysun/across/master/bbr.sh && bash bbr.sh install
```
Abort kernel removal? Choose No. Then we reboot the system. Log the system with ssh another time. BBR is abbreviation of "Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT" which optimize and control packages of **TCP**. BBR is supported above linux kernel 4.9.

```
sudo -i
bash bbr.sh start
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teddysun/shadowsocks_install/master/shadowsocksR.sh && chmod +x shadowsocksR.sh
./shadowsocksR.sh
```

Input the password and port ID. And then input "enter" all the time.

The ports of *TCP* and *UDP* In firewall pattern: **default-allow-http** and **default-allow-https** need to be changed to the ports set **above** just now.

One of firewall setting (such as *default-allow-https* and the other is *default-allow-http*) is displayed in detail as:
![default-allow-https1](https://github.com/bryanibit/bryanibit.github.io/raw/master/img/doc/firewall1.PNG)
![default-allow-https2](https://github.com/bryanibit/bryanibit.github.io/raw/master/img/doc/firewall2.PNG)

The complete setting of firewall is shown:
![default-allow-https-complete](https://github.com/bryanibit/bryanibit.github.io/raw/master/img/doc/firewall_whole.PNG)

From the above, we can see that the firewall rule is applied to all of VM instances. Add TCP ports of all of VM instances to *default-allow-https* and *default-allow-https*. In face, we can add different rules to difference instances, we can edit each instance to different web sign(网络标记)，namely, the red squre shows.

Enjoy!

You can also refer to the [link](https://appso.github.io/2017/09/12/bbr/).

## V2ray tutorial

Refer to the [githubBlog](https://toutyrater.github.io/), of course, you need to cross over the gfw.
The simple process can be concluded as following:
```sh
wget https://install.direct/go.sh
sudo bash go.sh
#modify port and id
sudo systemctl start v2ray
```

## BBR

TCP BBR is defaulted supported by Linux since kernel version 4.9. Use ```uname -r``` to check your Linux kernel version.  
It’s very easy to install **Linux kernel 4.10** on *Ubuntu 16.04*. You don’t have to manually download [the kernel from Ubuntu website](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/). Simply install the **Hardware Enablement Stack (HWE)(https://askubuntu.com/questions/248914/what-is-hardware-enablement-hwe)**(which is comparable to General Availability kernel), which provides newer kernel for Ubuntu LTS releases.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-16.04
```
Then how to check the server tcp condition?  
To check available congestion control algorithms, run the following command  
```
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
```

Output:
```
net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control = cubic reno
```

To check the current congestion control algorithm in use, run
```
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control
```

Output:
```
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = cubic
```

**The point** is how to turn on defaulted bbr algorithm on Linux whose kernel version is bigger then 4.9?  
Add the following two line at the end of the file called */etc/sysctl.conf*  
```
net.core.default_qdisc=fq
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr
```

And then reload sysctl configurations wihe command ```sudo sysctl -p```.  
Now check the congestion control algorithm in use with ```sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control```. The output should be ```net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr```, which prove you have turned on bbr successfully.
