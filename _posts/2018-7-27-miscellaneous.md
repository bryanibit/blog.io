## 小岛经济学

没有自由的失败，就没有自由的成功

## Effective Modern C++

It's been said that the truth shall set you free, but under the right circumstances, a well-chose lie can be equally liberating. We comprise "lie" to abstraction.

Bear in mind that the truth doesn't make the abstraction any less useful.

In short, rvalue reference should be *unconditionally* cast to rvalue (via **std::move**).

Universal refenrence should be *conditionally* cast to rvalue (via **std::forward**).
